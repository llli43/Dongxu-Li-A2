## Project Overview
A comprehensive Java application for managing theme park visitors and ride operations using object-oriented programming principles.

## Features
- **Visitor Management**: Track visitors with queue systems and ride history
- **Employee Management**: Manage ride operators and staff assignments  
- **Ride Operations**: Handle ride cycles, waiting queues, and capacity management
- **Data Persistence**: Export/import visitor data using file I/O operations
- **Advanced Collections**: Utilize Queue, LinkedList, and Comparator interfaces

## File Structure
- `Person.java` - Abstract base class for all persons
- `Employee.java` - Theme park staff management
- `Visitor.java` - Visitor information and tracking
- `RideInterface.java` - Contract for ride operations
- `Ride.java` - Main ride management implementation
- `VisitorComparator.java` - Custom sorting for visitors
- `AssignmentTwo.java` - Main demonstration class

## Technologies Used
